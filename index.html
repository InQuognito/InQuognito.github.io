<h1>Monsters Industries - 1.15.2</h1>
<blockquote>Monster Industries is not your typical, run-of-the-mill PvP map where it’s 2 teams that must face off in melee or ranged combat. No, this is industrial combat which means espionage, sabotage, and most importantly, monster warfare! The goal of this map is to get your company’s stock to rise, while simultaneously preventing the enemy company from getting their stock up.</blockquote>
